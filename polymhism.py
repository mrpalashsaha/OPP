there are two types of polymphism shich are 
a) method overriding and b) mrthod overloading 
in a class if you have two method with a same name but different parameters or argument is caled method overloading. but in python there is no such a thing 
if there are two class and both has the same method with same name is called method overloading. 

An Example of Method overloading: 

class Student:
 def __init__ (self, m1, m2):
 self.m1= m1 
 self.m2 = m2 
 
 def sum (self, a, b, c):
 s = 0;
 if a != None and b != None and c != None:
  s = a + b + c
 elif a != None and b != None:
  s= a + b
 else:
  s = a
 return s
 
 s1 = student (58, 69)
 print (s1.sum(5,9)
 
 
 An example of Method Overriding: 
 
 class A: 
  Def show (self):
    print (" in a Show")
   class B (A): 
    def show ("in B show" // overriding the A show method. 

   ABC = abstract base classes
 
 frpm abc import ABC, abstractmethod
 
 class computer(ABC):
      @abstractmethod 
      def process (self):
          pass 
   class Laptop(Computer):
       def process (self)
          print("Its Running")
