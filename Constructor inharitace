if you create object of subclass it will first try to find init of sub class if it is not there then it will go and look in the super class.
it is also possible to call the init form super class by mentioning super().__init__(), if you call super then it will first call init of super 
class then it will print the init of sub class.

when you have a multiple inharitance it will always start from left to right. so whatever you put in the left sde it will call that first.
to repreasent super class we use super method. 

 Introduction to Polymorphism in Python
 
 one thing can take multiple form. as human being we have different form we behave diffirent in different situation.
 there are four ways to implement polymorphism 
 1. Duck Typing
 2. operator overloading 
 3. Method overloading
 4. Method ovverridding. 
 
 1.  if it look like a Duck 
 swims like a duck 
 quacks like a duck 
 then it probabley a DUck
 
 operator overloading:
