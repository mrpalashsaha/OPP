Day 2: 
	there are two  kinds of variable which are 1. instance variable it can be changed according to the instance and 2. class (static variable)
	

	class car:

	wheels = 4               // it is defined outside the init so it is static variable and it will be the same for every intance. if you change the calss variables it wil be changed 					for all the instances

	def __inti__(self) 	// if you declear a varable intside the inti it becaome instance variable and those values changes according to the car so it is the instance variables
		self.mil = 10
		self.com = 'BMW' 	

	car_one = car()
	car_two = car()
	print(car_one.mil, car_one.com, car_one.wheels)
	print(car_two.mil, car_two.com, car_two.wheels)
